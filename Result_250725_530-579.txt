In this configuration, only the schema owner can grant or revoke privileges on the objects within the schema, preventing other users from doing so.
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 540 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What is the MOST cost-effective way to resolve memory spillage in a virtual warehouse?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
D - others explanation are good
B. Enable the query acceleration service. The query acceleration service dynamically adds additional compute resources (more CPU and memory) to a virtual warehouse when queries require more resources than initially allocated. This can be a cost-effective solution as it only scales up resources temporarily during peak demand, potentially reducing memory spillage without the need to permanently increase the warehouse size.

--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 547 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What factors impact storage costs in Snowflake? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     A, C
Korrekte Antwort:  A, C

Erklärung:
at the Snowflake billing layer your storage charge is simply a flat $/TB‑month rate, and that published rate only varies by:   Account type (On‑Demand vs Capacity pre‑purchase)   Region (US, EU, APAC, etc.)  All of the “cloud platform” differences are already baked into the single per‑TB list prices Snowflake publishes; you as a customer simply pick On‑Demand or Capacity and a region, and you pay that flat rate. The other choices (file format, data type, underlying provider) don’t change your Snowflake‑billed per‑TB price.
"The amount charged depends on your type of account (Capacity or On Demand) and region (US or EU)"
A,C, E The monthly costs for storing data in Snowflake are based on a flat rate per terabyte (TB) of consumption (after being compressed). The amount charged is determined by your account type (capacity or on demand), Cloud Platform, and the region, whether in the United States, Asia, or Europe.
In this page,  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-data-storage it mentioned that,  > The amount charged depends on your type of account (Capacity or On Demand) and region (US or EU).  So it should be A and C
