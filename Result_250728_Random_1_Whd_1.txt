Frage: Which of the following significantly improves the performance of selective point lookup queries on a table?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
The search optimization service aims to significantly improve the performance of certain types of queries on tables, including:  Selective point lookup queries on tables. A point lookup query returns only one or a small number of distinct rows. Use case examples include:  Business users who need fast response times for critical dashboards with highly selective filters.  Data scientists who are exploring large data volumes and looking for specific subsets of data.  Data applications retrieving a small set of results based on an extensive set of filtering predicates.

--- Frage Nr. 1001 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What privilege should a user be granted to change permissions for new objects in a managed access schema?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
It should be A because as both a & c answer are correct, the 'minimum' impacting option is Ownership
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema CREATE SCHEMA  WITH MANAGED ACCESS Specifies a managed schema. Managed access schemas centralize privilege management with the schema owner.  In regular schemas, the owner of an object (i.e. the role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) can grant further privileges on their objects to other roles. In managed schemas, the schema owner manages all privilege grants, including future grants, on objects in the schema. Object owners retain the OWNERSHIP privileges on the objects; however, only the schema owner can manage privilege grants on the objects.

Frage: How can a user MINIMIZE Continuous Data Protection costs when using large, high-churn, dimension tables?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
A - transient table are basically the same as regular table but do not utilize fail safe hence reducing the storage cost involved with them https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient#transient-tables
For large, high-churn dimension tables that incur overly-excessive CDP costs, the solution is to create these tables as transient with zero Time Travel retention (i.e. DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS=0) and then copy these tables on a periodic basis into a permanent table.

Frage: A user needs to create a materialized view in the schema MYDB.MYSCHEMA.

Which statements will provide this access?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
A is the correct answer https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html#examples
in all commands it is missing the keyword GRANT before "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW" The answer A is correct but the answer D is correct too because the keyword ROLE is  optional:  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html TO [ ROLE ] <role_name> [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]  So the question must allow for multiple answers.

--- Frage Nr. 1113 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which clustering indicator will show if a large table in Snowflake will benefit from explicitly defining a clustering key?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Clustering Depth The clustering depth for a populated table measures the average depth (1 or greater) of the overlapping micro-partitions for specified columns in a table. The smaller the average depth, the better clustered the table is with regards to the specified columns.  Clustering depth can be used for a variety of purposes, including:  Monitoring the clustering “health” of a large table, particularly over time as DML is performed on the table.  Determining whether a large table would benefit from explicitly defining a clustering key.

--- Frage Nr. 1148 (Richtig) ---
Frage: A Query Profile shows a UnionAll operator with an extra Aggregate operator on top.

What does this signify?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
UNION Without ALL In SQL, it is possible to combine two sets of data with either UNION or UNION ALL constructs. The difference between them is that UNION ALL simply concatenates inputs, while UNION does the same, but also performs duplicate elimination.  A common mistake is to use UNION when the UNION ALL semantics are sufficient. These queries show in Query Profile as a UnionAll operator with an extra Aggregate operator on top (which performs duplicate elimination).

--- Frage Nr. 34 (Richtig) ---
Frage: True or False: A third-party tool that supports standard JDBC or ODBC but has no Snowflake-specific driver will be unable to connect to Snowflake.
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
False.  A third-party tool that supports standard JDBC or ODBC can connect to Snowflake even without a Snowflake-specific driver. Snowflake provides JDBC and ODBC connectors that adhere to the standard JDBC and ODBC interfaces, allowing third-party tools to establish a connection to Snowflake using these standard protocols.  The Snowflake JDBC and ODBC connectors act as bridges between the third-party tools and the Snowflake service, enabling communication and data exchange. As long as the third-party tool supports JDBC or ODBC, it can utilize the Snowflake connectors to connect to Snowflake and interact with the data warehouse.  This approach ensures compatibility and interoperability with a wide range of tools and applications that support JDBC or ODBC, making it easier to integrate Snowflake into existing ecosystems or use preferred third-party tools for data analysis, reporting, or other purposes.
Answer is B False:  E.g. JDBC:  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/jdbc.html  Snowflake provides a JDBC type 4 driver that supports core JDBC functionality. The JDBC driver must be installed in a 64-bit environment and requires Java 1.8 (or higher). The driver can be used with most client tools/applications that support JDBC for connecting to a database server.

--- Frage Nr. 345 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which common query problems are identified by the Query Profile? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     B, D
Korrekte Antwort:  B, D

Erklärung:
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile#statistics B Pruning and D Spilling  Please stop quoting Chat GPT without verifying
Choose two. So best two. From https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile. Pruning - information on the effects of table pruning. Spilling — information about disk usage for operations where intermediate results do not fit in memory.
B. Inefficient pruning E. Object does not exist or not authorized  Explanation:  A Query Profile in Snowflake is designed to provide insights into the performance characteristics of a specific query. Common query problems that can be identified by the Query Profile include:  B. Inefficient pruning: It can reveal whether pruning (filtering) of data during query execution is being performed efficiently. Inefficient pruning may result in the query scanning more data than necessary.  E. Object does not exist or not authorized: The Query Profile can identify issues related to missing or unauthorized objects in the query. This includes situations where tables or columns referenced in the query do not exist or the user does not have the necessary privileges.  Syntax errors (A), ambiguous column names (C), and queries too large to fit in memory (D) are typically identified during the parsing and compilation phases and may not be specifically addressed by the Query Profile.

--- Frage Nr. 979 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What general guideline does Snowflake recommend when setting the auto-suspension time limit?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
B is correct. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#automating-warehouse-suspension
If you enable auto-suspend, we recommend setting it to a low value (e.g. 5 or 10 minutes or less) because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing. This will help keep your warehouses from running (and consuming credits) when not in use.  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations#automating-warehouse-suspension
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 1164 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What is the recommended way to obtain a cloned table with the same grants as the source table?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
CLONE command syntax supports the COPY GRANTS parameter. When the COPY GRANTS parameter is specified in a CREATE TABLE statement, the create operation copies all privileges, except OWNERSHIP, from the source table to the new table. The same behavior is true for other CREATE commands that support the COPY GRANTS clause.
A https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-clone#:~:text=When%20the%20COPY%20GRANTS%20parameter%20is%20specified%20in%20a%20CREATE%20TABLE%20statement%2C%20the%20create%20operation%20copies%20all%20privileges%2C%20except%20OWNERSHIP%2C%20from%20the%20source%20table%20to%20the%20new%20table.

--- Frage Nr. 412 (Richtig) ---
Frage: A user creates a stage using the following command:


CREATE STAGE mystage -
DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
FILE_FORMAT = myformat;

What will be the outcome?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
The below command creates a directory table for an internal stage with auto refresh  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-auto  CREATE STAGE my_int_stage  DIRECTORY = (  ENABLE = TRUE  AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE  );
Answer is B. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-manage#label-directory-table-refreshes Directory tables on internal stages require manual metadata refreshes. This command creates an internal Snowflake stage since it doesn't specify an external cloud storage location. I ran this command in Snowflake and it was valid and using SHOW STAGES; I validated that it was an internal stage, so the answer is B
B. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-manage "Directory tables on internal stages require manual metadata refreshes."  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-manage#label-directory-table-auto-refreshes "You can automatically refresh the metadata for a directory table by using the event messaging service for your cloud storage service."

Frage: Based on Snowflake recommendations, when creating a hierarchy of custom roles, the top-most custom role should be assigned to which role?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview#custom-roles  When creating roles that will serve as the owners of securable objects in the system, Snowflake recommends creating a hierarchy of custom roles, with the top-most custom role assigned to the system role SYSADMIN.

--- Frage Nr. 534 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What is an advantage of using database roles instead of granting privileges on objects directly to a share in Snowflake?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
But instead granting the shared database role allows the user to access only the subset of shared objects granted to the database role. The shared Database roles allow different groups of users in a data consumer account to access different subsets of the shared objects. https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-use-Database-Roles-in-a-Data-Share

--- Frage Nr. 142 (Richtig) ---
Frage: When reviewing a query profile, what is a symptom that a query is too large to fit into the memory?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
I agree with Answer D, if query spilling happens , query processing engine start saving the data to local disk if this is not sufficient then it start saving the data to remote disk, this process significantly impact query performance, the solution is use larger size warehouse.
For some operations (e.g. duplicate elimination for a huge data set), the amount of memory available for the compute resources used to execute the operation might not be sufficient to hold intermediate results. As a result, the query processing engine will start *spilling* the data to local disk. If the local disk space is not sufficient, the spilled data is then saved to remote disks. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile.html#queries-too-large-to-fit-in-memory

--- Frage Nr. 1022 (Richtig) ---
Frage: A data provider wants to share data with a consumer who does not have a Snowflake account. The provider creates a reader account for the consumer following these steps:

1. Created a user called "CONSUMER"
2. Created a database to hold the share and an extra-small warehouse to query the data
3. Granted the role PUBLIC the following privileges: Usage on the warehouse, database, and schema, and SELECT on all the objects in the share

Based on this configuration what is true of the reader account?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Answer is B: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-reader-create.html#overview

--- Frage Nr. 406 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What are potential impacts of storing non-native values like dates and timestamps in a VARIANT column in Snowflake?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Non-native values such as dates and timestamps are stored as strings when loaded into a VARIANT column, so operations on these values could be slower and also consume more space than when stored in a relational column with the corresponding data type.

--- Frage Nr. 462 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which query metric can be used to monitor the health of a large table?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
The key metric for monitoring the “health” of a large table in Snowflake is clustering depth. Clustering depth measures the average number of micro‑partition overlaps for the specified clustering key (or any set of columns), and a lower value indicates more effective clustering and thus better query pruning and performance. Tracking clustering depth over time as DML operations occur helps you detect when a table’s physical data layout degrades and may require reclustering.
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 468 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which Query Profile operator provides information on pruning efficiency?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
A. TableScan: This operator represents the action of reading data from a Snowflake table. Snowflake's architecture, based on micro-partitions and automatic clustering, allows for significant pruning. The Query Profile for a TableScan operator will show metrics such as:

Partitions scanned: The actual number of micro-partitions that were read. Partitions total: The total number of micro-partitions that comprise the table. The ratio of "Partitions scanned" to "Partitions total" directly indicates the pruning efficiency. A low ratio means high pruning efficiency.

Frage: True or False: It is possible to load data into Snowflake without creating a named File Format object.
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
True. Snowflake supports loading data without creating a named File Format object. Snowflake provides built-in file formats that can be used to load data without the need to create a file format object explicitly.  For example, to load a CSV file, you can use the built-in CSV file format by simply specifying the FILE_FORMAT option as CSV in the COPY INTO command. This allows you to quickly load data without the overhead of creating a named file format object.       Send a message...

Frage: What is the Fail-safe period for a transient table in the Snowflake Enterprise edition and higher?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A
