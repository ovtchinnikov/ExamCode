--- Frage Nr. 630 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What triggers the automated maintenance of a table's clustering key after it has been defined?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
Snowflake’s Automatic Clustering service does not run on a fixed schedule or via user‑defined tasks; instead, it monitors each clustered table continuously and automatically triggers maintenance only when the system determines that the table’s clustering will benefit from reclustering.

--- Frage Nr. 631 (Falsch) ---
Frage: How does Snowflake optimize queries on tables by leveraging the sorting and storage of data within micro-partitions?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Snowflake organizes table data into immutable micro‑partitions—small (50–500 MB uncompressed, up to 16 MB compressed) columnar files stored in cloud blob storage—where each partition’s columns are sorted and compressed independently. At query compile time, Snowflake uses per‑partition metadata (min/max values, distinct counts, byte offsets) to prune irrelevant partitions and skip unreferenced columns, drastically reducing I/O and network reads.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-micropartitions The micro-partition metadata maintained by Snowflake enables precise pruning of columns in micro-partitions at query run-time, including columns containing semi-structured data. These being said, it seems that pruning is done by column in micro-partitions, which is against all the questions we solved in this examtopics. I shall say that B, but I am not convinced anymore.

--- Frage Nr. 632 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What role should be used when creating a new user?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
I really hate these questions because the documentation says both the securityadmin and the useradmin can create, monitor and manage user and roles... but it seems like the best practice is to use useradmin for this task

Frage: When sharing data among multiple Snowflake accounts, what charges are incurred by a data consumer when viewing shared data using their own account?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Correct

--- Frage Nr. 635 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which objects can be cloned in Snowflake? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     B, C
Korrekte Antwort:  B, D

Erklärung:
A. Virtual warehouses: The documentation does not list virtual warehouses as clonable objects. This confirms our earlier assessment that they are not cloned in this manner.

B. Internal named stages: The documentation explicitly lists STAGE under "Other schema objects" that can be cloned. This covers internal named stages. CONFIRMED CLONABLE.

C. External named stages: The documentation explicitly lists STAGE under "Other schema objects" that can be cloned. This covers external named stages. CONFIRMED CLONABLE.

D. Dynamic tables: The documentation provides a specific syntax for cloning dynamic tables: CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE ... CLONE. CONFIRMED CLONABLE.

E. External tables: The documentation explicitly states under "Other schema objects" that external tables can be cloned. In a separate "Not cloned" section, it clarifies that "Cloning a database or schema does not clone external tables in the database or schema," implying that an individual external table can be cloned, but they are not automatically part of a database/schema clone. This distinction is subtle, but for the question "Which objects can be cloned", external tables individually can. CONFIRMED CLONABLE.

E. External tables: The documentation explicitly states under "Other schema objects" that external tables can be cloned. In a separate "Not cloned" section, it clarifies that "Cloning a database or schema does not clone external tables in the database or schema," implying that an individual external table can be cloned, but they are not automatically part of a database/schema clone. This distinction is subtle, but for the question "Which objects can be cloned", external tables individually can. CONFIRMED CLONABLE.
The documentation confirms that Internal named stages (B), External named stages (C), Dynamic tables (D), and External tables (E) are all objects that can be cloned in Snowflake.

--- Frage Nr. 636 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What happens to foreign key constraints when a table is cloned to another database?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
C. The cloned table will lose all references to the primary key. True. This is the most accurate statement. When an individual table is cloned, any foreign key constraints it had (which are "references to primary keys" in other tables) are not transferred to the cloned table. The cloned table will have no foreign key constraints unless you explicitly add them.

Frage: In a SPLIT_PART function, what will the returned value be if the partNumber is out of range?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Usage notes If the partNumber is out of range, the returned value is an empty string.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/split_part

--- Frage Nr. 640 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which Snowflake keywords help retrieve data without the need to completely scan a table? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     D, E
Korrekte Antwort:  D, E

Erklärung:
Both clauses are synonymous and tell Snowflake to perform a probabilistic (Bernoulli or block‑level) or fixed‑size sample before reading all micro‑partitions
Correct answer is DE : SAMPLE and TABLESAMPLE are synonimous https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/sample. LIMIT / FETCH and TOP[n] are also all equivalent and does require a complete scan of the table (plus are eliminated by default since there is 3 of them and the question asks for two answers)
SAMPLE  TABLESAMPLE  Both clauses are synonymous and tell Snowflake to perform a probabilistic (Bernoulli or block‑level) or fixed‑size sample before reading all micro‑partitions, so the engine can skip over large portions of the data store when only a sample is needed
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 641 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which data protection feature should only be used when all other data recovery options have been attempted?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
Fail‑Safe, is a non‑configurable, seven‑day, best‑effort recovery period provided solely by Snowflake after the Time Travel window closes, and should only be used when all other recovery options have been attempted
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 642 (Richtig) ---
Frage: A single cluster virtual warehouse has no free resources.

What will happen to new queries that are run against this warehouse?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
When there is only single cluster virtual warehouse , it can not SCALE and hence new queries need to wait in the Queue
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 643 (Falsch) ---
Frage: How can a Data Exchange Administrator provide a user with account access to a Data Exchange?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
A. Grant the user the USERADMIN role.
The USERADMIN role manages users and roles within an individual Snowflake account. Granting this role to a user in a separate consumer account is not how access to shared data is managed. Access to shared data is controlled at the share/listing level by the provider and then managed within the consumer's account by their own administrators.

B. Add the user to the Data Exchange.
While it's typically the consumer's account identifier (not an individual user within that account) that is added to a share or a private listing, this option best describes the administrative action taken by the Data Exchange Administrator. The administrator explicitly authorizes the consumer's account to access the data product. This is done by adding the consumer account's organization or account locator to the share's definition or the Marketplace listing's access control.

C. Enable the IMPORT SHARE privilege and grant this privilege to the user.
The IMPORT SHARE privilege is required in the consumer's account for a role to be able to create a database from a share. This privilege is granted by an administrator within the consumer's account to one of their own roles. It's not a privilege granted by the Data Exchange Administrator (provider) to a user in another account.

D. Create a new database for the Data Exchange and provide access to the user.
The Data Exchange Administrator (provider) does not create databases in the consumer's account. The consumer's account creates a database from the share that the provider makes available.

Therefore, the most appropriate description of how a Data Exchange Administrator provides account access is by authorizing the consumer's account, which can be broadly described as "adding the user (or more precisely, the user's account) to the Data Exchange."

The final answer is  
B

--- Frage Nr. 644 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What identifiers are supported when creating a Snowflake account hostname? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     C, D
Korrekte Antwort:  C, D

Erklärung:
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier As mentioned by 37ceea2, there are 2 options: 1. account name in your organization (preferred) 2. Account locator in region. The question is a bit confusing, but since there are 2 answers expected, Cloud region and Account locator seems to be the right option.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier Finding the region and locator for an account If you can connect to your Snowflake account, you can query the following context functions to identify the region and account locator for the Snowflake account you are connected to:  CURRENT_REGION retrieves the region in which your account is located.  CURRENT_ACCOUNT retrieves the account locator.  If you are unable to connect to Snowflake, contact the Snowflake administrator for your account to retrieve this information. This is the most close to the question's topic, I was able to find/

--- Frage Nr. 646 (Richtig) ---
Frage: When a transient table in Snowflake is dropped, what happens to the table?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
Transient tables in Snowflake behave much like permanent tables except they have no Fail‑Safe period and support at most a 1‑day Time Travel retention window. When you drop a transient table, it is moved into Time Travel and can be undropped only within that retention period; after the 1‑day window lapses, the table (and its data) is permanently irrecoverable.
Time Travel for Temporary and Transient tables is 0 or 1. Hence, even if the tables itself is no longer available for being used, it is possible to use it for 1 more day, if the Time Travel was set to 1. Hence, I vote C.
Snowflake didn't provide explicit information about the impact of dropping the transient table, but I have found this: https://hevodata.com/learn/what-is-snowflake-transient-table/. "For instance, if a system failure occurs and a Transitory Table is dropped or lost, the data is no longer accessible by you or Snowflake after one day. As a result, it’s advisable to use Snowflake Transient Table only for data that does not require failure protection or can be recreated outside of Snowflake." Hence, after max 1 day, the data will be lost.

--- Frage Nr. 654 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What ensures that a user with the role SECURITYADMIN can activate a network policy for an individual user?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
To activate a network policy for an individual user in Snowflake, the role executing the ALTER USER ... SET NETWORK_POLICY = ... command must have specific privileges.

According to Snowflake documentation, the role must have:

OWNERSHIP privilege on the network policy itself.

OWNERSHIP privilege on the user object.

The SECURITYADMIN role is a powerful built-in system role designed for managing security-related objects, including users and network policies, across the entire account. This means the SECURITYADMIN role inherently possesses the necessary privileges (or the ability to assume ownership) over all user objects and all network policy objects within the account.
The final answer is  
D

Frage: A user needs to MINIMIZE the cost of large tables that are used to store transitory data. The data does not need to be protected against failures, because the data can be reconstructed outside of Snowflake.

What table type should be used?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
transient tables provide a good option for managing the cost of very large tables used to store transitory data; recommend using transient tables only for data that does not need to be protected against failures or data that can be reconstructed outside of Snowflake.

--- Frage Nr. 658 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which functions can be used to share unstructured data through a secure view? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     A, B
Korrekte Antwort:  A, D

Erklärung:
A. BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL: This function generates a scoped URL that provides secure, temporary access to files in a Snowflake internal or external stage. The URL is "scoped" to the current query, meaning it's valid only for a short period and within the context of the executing session. This is an ideal function to embed within a secure view because it allows consumers to access the files without ever seeing the stage credentials or full path.

B. BUILD_STAGE_FILE_URL: This function constructs a URL to a file in a stage. However, it requires the user querying the view to have direct access to and knowledge of the stage and its credentials, which defeats the purpose of a secure view for data sharing where you want to hide these details. It's not designed for the secure, transient access needed for sharing via secure views.

C. GET_ABSOLUTE_PATH: This function retrieves the absolute path of a file from a directory table or external table. It provides path information, not a secure, temporary URL for direct access.

D. GET_PRESIGNED_URL: This function generates a pre-signed URL for files located in an external stage (e.g., in Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage). A pre-signed URL grants temporary access directly from the cloud storage provider, bypassing Snowflake credentials for that specific file access. This is a very common and secure method to share unstructured data via a secure view, as it allows the consumer to directly download or access the file from the cloud storage for a limited time.

E. GET_RELATIVE_PATH: This function retrieves the relative path of a file from a directory table or external table. It provides path information, not a secure, temporary URL for direct access.

Therefore, the functions that can be used to securely share unstructured data through a secure view are those that generate temporary, access-controlled URLs to the files.

The final answer is A,D

--- Frage Nr. 659 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which function will return a row for each for each object in a VARIANT, OBJECT, or ARRAY column?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Correct
The function that will return a row for each object in a VARIANT, OBJECT, or ARRAY column is B. FLATTEN.  The FLATTEN function is a table function that takes a VARIANT, OBJECT, or ARRAY column and returns a row for each element or attribute within the column. This can be useful for breaking down complex data structures into a more easily queryable form.

--- Frage Nr. 664 (Falsch) ---
Frage: What command would a user execute to load unstructured data files into a Snowflake internal stage?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
A. PUT: This command is specifically designed in Snowflake to upload files from a local directory (or another accessible location) to a specified internal or external stage.

B. GET: This command is used to download files from a Snowflake stage to a local file system. It's the reverse of PUT.

C. LIST: This command (or LS) is used to view a list of files that are already present in a Snowflake stage. It does not move data.

D. COPY INTO: This command is used for loading data from files in a stage into a table, or for unloading data from a table into files in a stage. It does not transfer files from an external location directly into a stage.

The final answer is  
A

--- Frage Nr. 665 (Falsch) ---
Frage: How do managed access schemas help with data governance?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
B is correct answer  With managed access schemas, object owners lose the ability to make grant decisions. Only the schema owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the schema) or a role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege can grant privileges on objects in the schema, including future grants, centralizing privilege management.

Frage: A Snowflake user wants to unload data from a relational table sized 5 GB using CSV. The extract needs to be as performant as possible.

What should the user do?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
By default, COPY INTO location statements separate table data into a set of output files to take advantage of parallel operations. The maximum size for each file is set using the MAX_FILE_SIZE copy option. The default value is 16777216 (16 MB) but can be increased to accommodate larger files. The maximum file size supported is 5 GB for Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure stages.

Frage: What is required for a query execution to be served from the result cache?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
The query text (SQL) must be identical for the query execution to be served from the result cache. If a query differs in any aspect of its SQL text, such as whitespace, capitalization, or literal values, it is considered a different query and will not be served from the result cache
I thin D  "Result Cache: Which holds the results of every query executed in the past 24 hours. These are available across virtual warehouses, so query results returned to one user is available to any other user on the system who executes the same query, provided the underlying data has not changed."  https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Caching-in-the-Snowflake-Cloud-Data-Platform
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 670 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which Snowflake URL type is used by directory tables?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
A. File: This is the most general and accurate description. The FILE_URL column provides a URL that allows access to the file itself, as managed by Snowflake's access to the external stage.

B. Pre-signed: A pre-signed URL is generated using the GET_PRESIGNED_URL function (which often takes the FILE_URL as an input). The FILE_URL itself, as stored in the directory table, is not a pre-signed URL; pre-signed URLs are time-limited and generated on demand.

C. Scoped: A scoped URL is generated using the BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL function and is primarily for secure, query-specific access, often within secure views. The FILE_URL in a directory table is not a scoped URL.

D. Virtual-hosted style: This refers to a specific style of URL used by object storage services like Amazon S3 (e.g., bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com). While the underlying external stage might use this style, the FILE_URL column provides a Snowflake-generated URL, not necessarily directly a virtual-hosted style URL.

Therefore, the most fitting description for the URL type used by directory tables in the FILE_URL column is a generic "File" URL provided by Snowflake.

The final answer is  
A

Frage: At which point is data encrypted when using a PUT command?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:

Frage: Which privileges are required for a user to restore an object? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     B, E
Korrekte Antwort:  B, E

Erklärung:
Similar to dropping an object, a user must have OWNERSHIP privileges for an object to restore it. In addition, the user must have CREATE privileges on the object type for the database or schema where the dropped object will be restored. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel

Frage: What is the abbreviated form to get all the files in the stage for the current user?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
B is correct because it says abbreviated form
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/list
There is https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/list Use the abbreviated form of the command to list all the files in the stage for the current user: LS @~;  Because it asks for "abbreviated form" B is correct
Thanks for the correction and yes LS is the abbreviated for form of List, so both are correct

--- Frage Nr. 677 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which features make up Snowflake's column level security? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     B, E
Korrekte Antwort:  B, C

Erklärung:
A. Continuous Data Protection (CDP): This refers to Snowflake's built-in features like Time Travel and Fail-safe, which protect data from accidental modification, deletion, or system failures. While essential for overall data security and availability, CDP does not directly provide column-level access control.

B. Dynamic Data Masking: This is a core feature of Snowflake's column-level security. It allows you to define a masking policy on a column. When users query that column, the data is dynamically transformed (e.g., masked, nulled out, or truncated) based on their role or other conditions. The actual data remains intact, but its presentation is altered for unauthorized users.

C. External Tokenization: This is another advanced feature that provides column-level security. With external tokenization, sensitive data is tokenized (encrypted or replaced with a non-sensitive token) before it's loaded into Snowflake. When authorized users query the data in Snowflake, an external function is called to detokenize (unmask) the data, allowing them to see the original sensitive values. This ensures that the sensitive data is never stored unencrypted in Snowflake.

D. Key pair authentication: This is an authentication method that allows users to connect to Snowflake using a public/private key pair instead of a username and password. It's a method for verifying user identity, not for controlling access to specific columns within tables.

E. Row access policies: This feature provides row-level security. It allows you to define a policy that filters which rows a user can see in a table based on their role or other conditions. It controls vertical access (which rows are visible), not horizontal access (which columns are visible or masked).

Therefore, the features that specifically make up Snowflake's column-level security are Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization.

The final answer is B,C

Frage: Which programming languages are supported for Snowflake User-Defined Functions (UDFs)? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     B, E
Korrekte Antwort:  B, D

Erklärung:
The natively supported languages for UDFs in Snowflake are:

SQL: For defining simple, tabular, or scalar SQL functions.

JavaScript: For more complex procedural logic.

Python: Supported via Snowpark for Python UDFs, allowing rich libraries and complex logic.

Java: Supported via Snowpark for Java UDFs.

Scala: Supported via Snowpark for Scala UDFs.

Now, let's evaluate the given options:



A. C#: C# is not directly supported for UDFs in Snowflake.

B. JavaScript: Yes, JavaScript is a natively supported language for Snowflake UDFs.

C. PHP: PHP is not directly supported for UDFs in Snowflake.

D. Python: Yes, Python is a natively supported language for Snowflake UDFs.

E. TypeScript: While TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, it's not directly executed as TypeScript within Snowflake UDFs. You would write UDFs in JavaScript.

Therefore, the two programming languages supported for Snowflake UDFs from the provided list are JavaScript and Python.

The final answer is B,D

Frage: What is the MAXIMUM number of days that Snowflake resets the 24-hour retention period for a query result every time the result is used?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
Each time the persisted result for a query is reused, Snowflake resets the 24-hour retention period for the result, up to a maximum of 31 days from the date and time that the query was first executed. After 31 days, the result is purged and the next time the query is submitted, a new result is generated and persisted.
