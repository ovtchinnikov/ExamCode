--- Frage Nr. 432 (Richtig) ---
Frage: How can data be shared between two users who have different Snowflake accounts?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
you create a share in the provider account, grant object privileges to that share, and then assign the IMPORT SHARE privilege to the appropriate role in the consumer account so they can CREATE DATABASE … FROM SHARE

--- Frage Nr. 280 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which cache type is used to cache data output from SQL queries?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Result Cache:  Which holds the results of every query executed in the past 24 hours. These are available across virtual warehouses, so query results returned to one user is available to any other user on the system who executes the same query, provided the underlying data has not changed. Local Disk Cache:  Which is used to cache data used by SQL queries. Whenever data is needed for a given query it's retrieved from the Remote Disk storage, and cached in SSD and memory.

--- Frage Nr. 740 (Falsch) ---
Frage: Which Snowflake object helps evaluate virtual warehouse performance impacted by query queuing?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
warehouse_load_history
The user is referring to this in particular:  Query History: It keeps a record of all queries executed in your Snowflake account. This allows you to analyze the performance of individual queries, including their execution time, number of rows processed, etc. However, it does not provide specific information on the impact of query queuing on virtual warehouse performance. WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY: This system view provides specific information on the usage of the virtual warehouse, including the wait times of queries in the queue. This allows you to evaluate the impact of query queuing on virtual warehouse performance by providing data on warehouse load and usage. So, if you want to assess the impact of query queuing on virtual warehouse performance, the WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY view would be more appropriate. If you want to examine the performance of individual queries as a whole, then Query History would be more relevant
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-load-monitoring
Even C seems to be correct. But, the Query History provides more information than the Load history.  AVG_QUEUED_LOAD. Query load value for queries queued because the warehouse was overloaded. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/warehouse_load_history

Frage: How can a dropped internal stage be restored?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
From docs  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/drop-stage#:~:text=Usage%20notes,must%20be%20recreated.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop You can undrop DB, SCHEMA, TABLE, also ACCOUNT and TAG
D. Recreate the dropped stage. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel#introduction-to-time-travel Using Time Travel, you can perform the following actions within a defined period of time:  Query data in the past that has since been updated or deleted.  Create clones of entire tables, schemas, and databases at or before specific points in the past.  Restore tables, schemas, and databases that have been dropped.  Doesn't look like you can restore a dropped stage using UNDROP and time travel. Looks like you just need to recreate it using your SQL definition.
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 876 (Richtig) ---
Frage: When a database is cloned, which objects in the clone inherit all granted privileges from the source object? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     C, D
Korrekte Antwort:  C, D

Erklärung:
If the source object is a database or schema, the clone inherits all granted privileges on the clones of all child objects contained in the source object:  For databases, contained objects include schemas, tables, views, etc.  For schemas, contained objects include tables, views, etc.  Note that the clone of the container itself (database or schema) does not inherit the privileges granted on the source container.  c d

--- Frage Nr. 464 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What is the recommended way to insert a VARIANT value into a Snowflake table?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
TO_VARIANT Cannot Be Used Directly in VALUES  The TO_VARIANT function cannot appear directly inside a VALUES clause in an INSERT; instead, you must select from it: Explicit Casting and JSON Parsing  Snowflake supports multiple ways to produce VARIANT values in the SELECT:   TO_VARIANT(<expr>) converts any SQL expression to VARIANT.  <expr>::VARIANT or CAST(<expr> AS VARIANT) for explicit casting.  PARSE_JSON('<json>') to turn a JSON string into VARIANT.   INSERT INTO to_variant_example (v_varchar, v_object)  SELECT  TO_VARIANT('Hello'),   PARSE_JSON('{"key":"value"}');
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_variant "The TO_VARIANT function cannot be used directly in an INSERT statement. Instead, use INSERT INTO ... SELECT....  Hence, ANSWER B is not correct.  As per the right answer, or A, or D. I am saying D, only because I have to select an answer. Please, see below syntax, for JSON: INSERT INTO to_variant_example (v_varchar, v_number, v_timestamp, v_array, v_object)  SELECT  TO_VARIANT('Skiing is fun!'),  TO_VARIANT(3.14),  TO_VARIANT('2024-01-25 01:02:03'),  TO_VARIANT(ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('San Mateo', 'Seattle', 'Berlin')),  PARSE_JSON(' { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" } ');  SELECT * FROM to_variant_example; Not very confident that this will help here.
I have analyzed more on the info from my previous email. My answer is A.

correct
D correct - Notify & Suspend   Send a notification (to all account administrators with notifications enabled) and suspend all assigned warehouses after all statements being executed by the warehouse(s) have completed. Notify & Suspend Immediately   Send a notification (to all account administrators with notifications enabled) and suspend all assigned warehouses immediately, which cancels any statements being executed by the warehouses at the time.
Correct answer is D https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors Notify Notify&Suspend Notify and suspend immediately where the running queries are cancelled

Frage: When creating a virtual warehouse, what setting should be used to avoid both over-provisioning resources and auto-scaling when there is increased concurrency?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
set MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1, not 10
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service  ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION is designed to improve performance for queries that experience high concurrency or large data scans without requiring additional manual scaling of resources. This feature dynamically allocates additional resources as needed for certain queries, avoiding both over-provisioning (which wastes resources) and scaling the number of clusters.

--- Frage Nr. 113 (Richtig) ---
Frage: True or False: Data Providers can share data with only the Data Consumer.
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
False. In Snowflake, data sharing is not limited to sharing data with only a single data consumer. Snowflake allows data providers to share data with multiple data consumers or even make data publicly accessible, depending on the configured sharing settings.  With Snowflake's secure data sharing capabilities, data providers can share specific datasets or entire databases with one or more data consumers. Data consumers can be given read-only access to the shared data, allowing them to query and analyze the data without being able to modify or change it. This flexible data sharing model enables collaboration and data exchange between different organizations or teams within an organization.  Furthermore, Snowflake also provides granular access controls and permissions, allowing data providers to define who can access their shared data and what level of access each data consumer has. This ensures data privacy and security while enabling effective data sharing and collaboration.
