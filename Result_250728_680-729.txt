Frage: There are 300 concurrent users on a production Snowflake account using a single cluster virtual warehouse. The queries are small, but the response time is very slow.

What is causing this to occur?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
I choose A although D in my opinion is also correct.  B - STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS - from snowflake:  "Amount of time, in seconds, a SQL statement (query, DDL, DML, etc.) remains queued for a warehouse before it is canceled by the system. This parameter can be used in conjunction with the MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL parameter to ensure a warehouse is never backlogged."  D - if queries do not take advantage of cached results, it causes the queries to be fully executed --> meaning, they take compute resources and time.
A is correct

--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 686 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Why would a Snowflake user create a secure view instead of a standard view?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
Answer should be B Why Should I Use Secure Views? For a non-secure view, internal optimizations can indirectly expose data.  Some of the internal optimizations for views require access to the underlying data in the base tables for the view. This access might allow data that is hidden from users of the view to be exposed through user code, such as user-defined functions, or other programmatic methods. Secure views do not utilize these optimizations, ensuring that users have no access to the underlying data.
B is correct answer. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-secure
--------------------------------------------------

--- Frage Nr. 687 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which command can be added to the COPY command to make it load all files, whether or not the load status of the files is known?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
Parameter FORCE - Applies to all files in the source.Reload previously loaded files.  LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES Applies only to files flagged as uncertain.Retry loading files with uncertain status.
A is correct. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table To force the COPY command to load all files regardless of whether the load status is known, use the FORCE option instead.
Workarounds To load files whose metadata has expired, set the LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES copy option to true. The copy option references load metadata, if available, to avoid data duplication, but also attempts to load files with expired load metadata.  Alternatively, set the FORCE option to load all files, ignoring load metadata if it exists. Note that this option reloads files, potentially duplicating data in a table.

--- Frage Nr. 689 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which Snowflake feature allows administrators to identify unused data that may be archived or deleted?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
Access history in Snowflake provides the following benefits pertaining to read and write operations: Data discovery: Discover unused data to determine whether to archive or delete the data.  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/access-history#:~:text=Discover%20unused%20data%20to%20determine%20whether%20to%20archive%20or%20delete%20the%20data.
Each row in the ACCESS_HISTORY view contains a single record per SQL statement. The record describes the columns the query accessed directly and indirectly (i.e. the underlying tables that the data for the query comes from). These records facilitate regulatory compliance auditing and provide insights on popular and frequently accessed tables and columns since there is a direct link between the user (i.e. query operator), the query, the table or view, the column, and the data
Data classification is to classify personal data. it is a governance feature, https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/governance-classify. So answer should be A.

--- Frage Nr. 692 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What privilege does a user need in order to receive or request data from the Snowflake Marketplace?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
A. CREATE DATA EXCHANGE LISTING: This privilege is for providers to create listings, not for consumers to access them.

B. CREATE SHARE: This privilege is for creating shares, typically by a data provider, not for a consumer to receive data.

C. IMPORT SHARE: This is the correct privilege needed by a consumer account to view and create databases from shared data, including those from the Snowflake Marketplace.

D. IMPORTED PRIVILEGES: This privilege is used for enabling roles other than the owning role to access a shared database after it has been created from a share, or to manage a Snowflake Marketplace/Data Exchange in specific administrative contexts. It's not the primary privilege for the initial act of receiving/requesting data from the Marketplace.

Therefore, the IMPORT SHARE privilege is the core requirement for a user to receive or request data from the Snowflake Marketplace. (Note: CREATE DATABASE is also typically required to then create a database from the share, but IMPORT SHARE is the one specifically for viewing and enabling the share for consumption).

--- Frage Nr. 697 (Richtig) ---
Frage: How can a Snowflake user configure a virtual warehouse to support over 100 users if their company has Enterprise Edition?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
multi-cluster warehouse is the solution for simultaneous querying.
Multi-cluster warehouses are best utilized for scaling resources to improve concurrency for users/queries. They are not as beneficial for improving the performance of slow-running queries or data loading. For these types of operations, resizing the warehouse provides more benefits.  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-multicluster

--- Frage Nr. 701 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What is the MOST efficient way to load streaming data into Snowflake?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
A. Use the COPY command: The COPY INTO command is designed for batch loading of data from staged files into Snowflake tables. While it can be automated to run periodically, it's not truly "streaming" and introduces latency as it relies on files accumulating in a stage and a virtual warehouse to process them. It's not the most efficient for continuous, low-latency streaming data.

B. Use Snowpipe: Snowpipe is Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service.

Classic Snowpipe: Automatically loads data from files as soon as they are staged in a cloud storage location (e.g., S3, Azure Blob, GCS). It uses Snowflake-managed compute resources that automatically scale, making it highly efficient for micro-batching and near real-time ingestion.

Snowpipe Streaming: This is the latest evolution for streaming. It allows applications to send rows of data directly to Snowflake tables without the need for staging files. This eliminates file-related overhead and provides the lowest latency (sub-second) for continuous data streams. It's ideal for real-time analytics and highly efficient for both steady streams and bursts of data.

C. Use the Load Data Wizard: The Load Data Wizard (in Snowsight) is a graphical interface for manual or ad-hoc batch loading of files from a local machine or a stage into a table. It's not designed for continuous, automated streaming data ingestion.

D. Use tasks and streams: While Snowflake Streams track change data capture (CDC) on tables and Tasks can execute SQL statements (including COPY INTO or DML) on a schedule or when a stream has new data, this combination is typically used for ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines after data has already landed in Snowflake (or a staging table). It helps process changes to data, but it's not the primary or most efficient method for the initial ingestion of continuous streaming data into Snowflake from an external source. Snowpipe is specifically built for that initial ingestion.

Given the options and the requirement for "MOST efficient way to load streaming data," Snowpipe (encompassing both classic Snowpipe for micro-batches and Snowpipe Streaming for row-level real-time ingestion) is the clear answer.

The final answer is B

--- Frage Nr. 705 (Richtig) ---
Frage: What does Snowflake recommend as a best practice for using secure views?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
A. Use sequence-generated values.

This describes using sequences, which is common. However, it doesn't address the best practice for exposing them via a secure view.

B. Programmatically reveal the identifiers.

This contradicts the idea of secure views being used to hide sensitive information. If the goal is to protect data or IP, actively revealing identifiers (even programmatically) would go against that.

C. Use secure views solely for query convenience.

While views can provide query convenience, the secure aspect of a secure view is specifically for security and hiding the definition. Its purpose is not solely for convenience; that would typically apply to standard views.

D. Do not expose the sequence-generated column(s).

This is a recommended best practice. By not exposing internal, system-generated identifiers like sequence columns in a secure view, you enhance data privacy, prevent potential reverse engineering of your data processes, and avoid revealing unnecessary internal schema details to consumers. If a unique identifier is truly needed for the consumer, a transformed or hashed version might be provided instead.

The final answer is D

Frage: What is the Fail-safe period for a transient table in the Snowflake Enterprise edition and higher?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  A

Erklärung:
Temporary and Transient Tables¶ To help manage the storage costs associated with Time Travel and Fail-safe, Snowflake provides two table types, temporary and transient, which do not incur the same fees as standard (i.e. permanent) tables:  Transient tables can have a Time Travel retention period of either 0 or 1 day.  Temporary tables can also have a Time Travel retention period of 0 or 1 day; however, this retention period ends as soon as the table is dropped or the session in which the table was created ends.  Transient and temporary tables have no Fail-safe period.  As a result, the maximum

Frage: Which statement accurately describes Snowflake's architecture?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
Snowflake Architecture Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures. Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the platform. But similar to shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using MPP (massively parallel processing) compute clusters where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts

Frage: Which statistic displayed in a Query Profile is specific to external functions?
Deine Antwort:     B
Korrekte Antwort:  B

Erklärung:
for sure B total invocations
The following statistics are shown for each external function called by the SQL statement. If the same function was called more than once from the same SQL statement, then the statistics are aggregated.  Total invocations — number of times that an external function was called. (This can be different from the number of external function calls in the text of the SQL statement due to the number of batches that rows are divided into, the number of retries (if there are transient network problems), etc.)

Frage: If there is queueing in the virtual warehouse load monitoring chart, what should a Snowflake user do?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
We don't have information about Snowflake edition. For Standard edition we don't have option with multi-cluster.
It's queuing issue hence you dont need new warehouse but need additional clusters within same warehouse. And as queries are already in system hence can't move queries to new warehouse without killing and resubmitting.
Both C & D are correct. C: If the running query load is high or there’s queuing, consider starting a separate warehouse and moving queued queries to that warehouse. D: Alternatively, if you are using multi-cluster warehouses, you could change your multi-cluster settings to add additional clusters to handle higher concurrency going forward.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-load-monitoring  Slow Query Performance When you notice that a query is running slowly, check whether an overloaded warehouse is causing the query to compete for resources or get queued:  If the running query load is high or there’s queuing, consider starting a separate warehouse and moving queued queries to that warehouse. Alternatively, if you are using multi-cluster warehouses, you could change your multi-cluster settings to add additional clusters to handle higher concurrency going forward.

--- Frage Nr. 720 (Richtig) ---
Frage: Which loop type iterates until a condition is true?
Deine Antwort:     C
Korrekte Antwort:  C

Erklärung:
A. FOR loop: Iterates a fixed number of times, or over elements in a collection/range. It's not primarily controlled by an "until true" condition.

B. LOOP (unconditional): In some programming contexts (like Snowflake Scripting or PL/SQL), a simple LOOP ... END LOOP creates an infinite loop that requires an explicit BREAK statement to exit, usually within an IF condition. It doesn't inherently iterate "until true" as part of its base syntax.

C. REPEAT loop: This loop construct executes its body at least once and then continues to re-execute the body until a specified condition becomes true. Once the condition is true, the loop terminates.

D. WHILE loop: This loop construct continues to execute its body as long as a specified condition is true. If the condition becomes false, the loop terminates. The condition is checked at the beginning, so the loop body might not execute at all if the condition is initially false.

Therefore, the REPEAT loop directly matches the description "iterates until a condition is true".

--- Frage Nr. 722 (Falsch) ---
Frage: How is enhanced authentication achieved in Snowflake? (Choose two.)
Deine Antwort:     C, D
Korrekte Antwort:  D, E

Erklärung:
A. Password: While passwords are a fundamental part of authentication, they are considered a basic form of authentication. "Enhanced authentication" typically refers to methods that add layers of security or integrate with external identity systems.

B. Snowflake-managed keys: Snowflake-managed keys are related to data encryption (data at rest and in transit) within the Snowflake environment. This is a data security feature, not a method for user authentication.

C. Object level access control: This refers to authorization, which dictates what an authenticated user can do or access (e.g., SELECT on a table, USAGE on a warehouse). It's distinct from authentication, which verifies who the user is.

D. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA significantly enhances authentication security by requiring users to provide two or more different types of verification factors (e.g., something they know like a password, something they have like a phone or token, something they are like a fingerprint). This is a direct method of enhanced authentication.

E. Federated authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO): Federated authentication allows users to authenticate against an external Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, ADFS) that Snowflake trusts. SSO is often a capability of federated authentication, allowing users to log in once to their IdP and gain seamless access to Snowflake and other applications. This provides centralized identity management and enhanced security.

Therefore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Federated authentication/Single Sign-On (SSO) are key features for achieving enhanced authentication in Snowflake.

Frage: If queries start to queue in a multi-cluster virtual warehouse an additional compute cluster starts immediately under what setting?
Deine Antwort:     A
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
A. Auto-scale mode: This is a general term for the ability of multi-cluster warehouses to scale, not a specific policy.

B. Maximized mode: This is not a standard Snowflake scaling policy name.

C. Economy scaling policy: This policy would not start a cluster immediately upon queuing; it waits for full utilization.

D. Standard scaling policy: This policy is designed to start new clusters immediately when queries begin to queue.

The final answer is D

Frage: When floating-point number columns are unloaded to CSV or JSON files, Snowflake truncates the values to approximately what?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
Looking at the provided options, we need to find the one that best reflects "15 decimal digits of precision" in a (Precision, Scale) format, where Precision (P) is the total number of digits and Scale (S) is the number of digits after the decimal point.

A. (12,2) - Represents a number with 12 total digits and 2 decimal places. Too low precision.

B. (10,4) - Represents a number with 10 total digits and 4 decimal places. Too low precision.

C. (14,8) - Represents a number with 14 total digits and 8 decimal places. Close, but not exactly 15 total digits.

D. (15,9) - Represents a number with 15 total digits and 9 decimal places. This option directly corresponds to the "15 decimal digits of precision" mentioned in the documentation as it implies 15 significant figures.

The final answer is D

Frage: What happens when a user exits Snowsight during a session that a query is running?
Deine Antwort:     D
Korrekte Antwort:  D

Erklärung:
Here's what happens:

Once a query is successfully submitted to the Snowflake service and begins execution on a virtual warehouse, its processing becomes independent of the client session (e.g., the Snowsight tab, browser, or client application).

The query will continue to execute on the virtual warehouse until it completes, encounters an error, or hits a defined timeout (e.g., STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS set at the account, user, session, or warehouse level).

Closing the browser tab, navigating away from Snowsight, or logging out does not automatically cancel the running query on the Snowflake backend.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

D. Snowflake will continue to execute and complete upon the next login. When the user logs back into Snowsight, they can check their Query History, and the completed query and its results will be visible there (assuming the results are still within the query result cache retention period, typically 24 hours, but can extend to 31 days with reuse).

The final answer is D
